# GatePlane 🚀

GatePlane is created to make **time-based**, **conditional access management** approachable and transparent, *made by Security Professionals for Security Professionals*.

It implements *Just-In-Time* (JIT) ⏱️, *Privileged Access Management* (PAM) 🔐, helping tech groups and companies to give, revoke and monitor permissions across the whole organization.

It is using [Hashicorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault) / [OpenBao](https://openbao.org/), to ensure *we don't re-invent the AuthN/AuthZ wheel*, but create true value for the already existing community.

Our take on this implementation is that its source is fully available, with a vision to *empower the community* to **contribute**, **innovate** and ultimately **support** teams and businesses through the power of collaboration.

## The challenge 👩‍💻👨‍💻

If you ever heard one of the quotes below, GatePlane is for you.

##### Developer:
> "I need to debug production but I don't have access"

##### IT Person:
> “I get around 60 requests for sensitive access per day, and I have to manually set them up and tear them down”

##### Security Officer:
> “I have no idea who has access to what after the last incident and the auditor comes next week”

##### Security Engineer:
> “Setting up this PAM solution will take forever and will change everything we know about our infrastructure”

***Sounds Familiar?***

## Our Vision 🌍
With everything said, we as security engineers and proud members of the security community
envision a world where access management is effortless, secure, and built in the open for everyone 🤝.

We aim to achieve this purpose by creating a community-driven solution that sets new standards for collaboration and innovation across infosec professionals around the world.
